title: The Emo Map (I)
---

A project I've been working on to practice some coding skills. (I'm not a data scientist, just a guy who likes emo.)  

Here's the map:

Overall, I had a sample size of 1,543 bands. I recorded *bands* per city, not *releases* per city. I used the webscraping tool ParseHub to obtain the data from Bandcamp (nothing fancy, basically just automating the process of clicking every band's page) and Leaflet to create the map. I chose a black colour scheme because it's more emo. 

Some notes: 

- I can't vouch for the accuracy of this, especially the band names, 100%. I tried to manually check whenever I could but this was automated. 

- Furthest north artist: The formula counted record labels so technically, <a href="https://polarxsummer.bandcamp.com/music"> Polar Summer Records </a>, which is located north of the Arctic circle in Vorkuta, Russia. However, all of their releases seem to be from cities further south in Siberia. 

- Furthest south artist: <a href="https://alexacasino.bandcamp.com/music">Alexa Casino</a> and <a href="https://badfriendnz.bandcamp.com/">bad friend</a>, from Wellington, NZ.

- Midwest Emo is real. Chicago is the undisputed king of this map. 

- There's an argument to be made that the only "true" emo bands are those who don't describe themselves as emo, or tag themselves as "emo" on Bandcamp.

- There's another argument to be made that "Real Emo" only consists of the dc Emotional Hardcore scene and the late 90's Screamo scene. What is known by "Midwest Emo" is nothing but Alternative Rock with questionable real emo influence.
