title: The Emo Map (I)
---

A year ago, I tried to make a map of the bands under the emo tag on Bandcamp using a 3rd party web app. I figured I'd try again. I'm not sure if it came out any better, but spending time with the data was fun. I'm not a data scientist, just a guy who likes emo.  

Here's the map:

Overall, I had a sample size of 1,543 bands. I recorded *bands* per city, not *releases* per city. I used the webscraping tool ParseHub to obtain the data from Bandcamp (nothing fancy, basically just automating the process of clicking every band's page) and Leaflet to create the map. I chose a black colour scheme because it's more emo. 

Some notes: 

- Yes, I recorded all the names of the bands. There were just way too many to fit onto some of these labels accessibly. If anyone has any ideas of how to do that, or any other fun things to do with the data, please tell me.

- Furthest north artist: The formula counted record labels so technically, <a href="https://polarxsummer.bandcamp.com/music"> Polar Summer Records </a>, which is located north of the Arctic circle in Vorkuta, Russia. However, all of their releases seem to be from cities further south in Siberia. 

- Furthest south artist: <a href="https://alexacasino.bandcamp.com/music">Alexa Casino</a> and <a href="https://badfriendnz.bandcamp.com/">bad friend</a>, from Wellington, NZ.

- Midwest Emo is real. Chicago is the undisputed king of this map. 

- There's an argument to be made that the only "true" emo bands are those who don't describe themselves as emo, or tag themselves as "emo" on Bandcamp.

- There's another argument to be made that "Real Emo" only consists of the dc Emotional Hardcore scene and the late 90's Screamo scene. What is known by "Midwest Emo" is nothing but Alternative Rock with questionable real emo influence.
